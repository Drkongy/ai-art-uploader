Copy code
python script_name.py
The script performs the following steps:

Extract Image Data:

The script reads the specified log file and uses BeautifulSoup to extract image data and metadata.
Metadata includes prompt, seed, and full raw prompt.
Check if File Exists on Server:

The script checks if the image already exists on the server by calling the CHECK_FILE_API_URL endpoint.
Upload Image:

If the image does not exist on the server, it uploads the image to the UPLOAD_API_URL endpoint.
If the upload is successful, it calls the post_metadata function to upload the metadata.
Progress Bar:

The script uses tqdm to display a progress bar while processing images and during the countdown between checks.
Example Output
The script provides a progress bar to indicate the processing of images:

Processing Images:  50%|███████████████████████████▌                       | 5/10 [00:15<00:15,  3.00s/it]
Extending the Script
